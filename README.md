dvn: Access to the Dataverse Network API from R
========

This package provides basic access to the Data Sharing API for the Dataverse Network online data repository (http://thedata.org/). The package enables searches of any public dataverse, returning study and file metadata. Limited support is also provided for data download. Future support is planned for the upcoming Data Deposit API, which will allow uploading of data to a dataverse directly from R.
